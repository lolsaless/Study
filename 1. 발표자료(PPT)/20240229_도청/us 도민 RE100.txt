The Way Forward
The economic burden on residents is increasing due to the increase in energy bills such as electricity, gas, and water.
We will provide 'Energy Opportunity Income' to ease the burden of energy costs and provide opportunities for additional income generation through participatory renewable energy generation.
We will improve farmers' incomes by introducing farming-type solar power, which is actively being introduced worldwide.

Initiatives
Promotion of Climate Action Opportunity Income
(Project Details) Promote 'Opportunity Income' based on the performance of 14 carbon-neutral activities (GHG reduction) in 4 fields

(Target of support)Payment of local currency within the range of up to 60,000 won per citizen/per person per year

(Project budget) KRW 3,600 million (contribution from Gyeonggi Environment and Energy Promotion Agency)

(Platform) Establishment of a climate action opportunity income platform (incentivized based on the performance of 14 action activities in 4 areas)

| Fields | Criteria | Collaborators|
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Energy Saving | Reducing electricity, water, and gas usage | Korea Environment Agency |
| Eco-driving | Performance in eco-driving (adherence to economic speed, sudden acceleration, slowing down, refraining from idling) | |
| Public transportation use | Increased use of public transportation such as buses and subways | Locamobility |
| Use of multi-serving containers | Increased use of multi-serving containers when ordering delivery food | Gyeonggi-do Corporation |
| Green Products | Use of green products and green food among credit card usage | Green Card Operator |
| Environmental Education and Volunteer Service | Completion of carbon neutrality-related education and environmental volunteer activities | Gyeonggi-do, Si-gun |


In the future, we plan to expand support areas by integrating with the Ministry of Environment's carbon neutrality points (energy, automobile).

(Energy Opportunity Income Village) Provide income generation opportunities of more than KRW 150,000 per household per month and revitalize the village economy by supporting the installation of commercial solar power generation facilities (10~14kW per household) in village communities in vulnerable energy-use areas.
(Energy Independent Village) Promoting energy cost reduction for residents by supporting the installation of private + commercial solar power generation facilities in areas without city gas supply
(Energy Independent Households) Reducing energy costs and realizing a decentralized energy system by supporting part of the cost of installing 3kW-scale solar facilities in single/multi-family houses in Seoul (100,000 Electricity Independent Households Project)
(Mini Solar Supply) Supporting the supply of up to 800W of mini solar power by utilizing home verandas and rooftops to reduce electricity bills
(Interest Support for Green Remodeling of Private Buildings) Gyeonggi Province will additionally support a portion of the differential interest rate between the support rate of the Green Remodeling Creation Center of the Korea Land Safety Management Institute (4-5%) and the commercial bank interest rate (7%) (1-2% level).
(Promoting the improvement of laws and systems related to agricultural photovoltaics) Early enactment of the 'Agricultural Photovoltaic Support Act' and revision of the 'Agricultural Land Act', and requesting the establishment of REC weighting to improve the economics of agricultural photovoltaics
