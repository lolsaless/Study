1. Direction
We will create a large-scale renewable energy agglomeration complex by attracting private capital to build a stable power supply system for global RE100 companies in Korea.
We will generate 3.2 GW (4 TWh/year) of electricity in eight special zones to supply renewable energy to global RE100 companies (57 business sites) in the province.
We will create a financial foundation for Gyeonggi-do to realize carbon neutrality, support RE100 companies, and just energy transition (including support for vulnerable groups).
We will support energy efficiency projects for SMEs in the province to achieve carbon neutrality and strengthen corporate competitiveness.

Initiatives
Promote RE100 in industrial complexes
Establish a win-win model for residents, industrial park tenants, and global RE100 companies by promoting a public-private partnership rooftop solar installation project (supplying electricity to RE100 companies)

| Classification | Main Role | Expected Effects|
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Industrial complex tenant companies | Lease building roofs | Receive rental income, renovate old roofs, and ease the burden of installing energy efficiency facilities |
| Gyeonggi-do residents | Collective investment, fund investment | Secure dividends, investment income |
| RE100 companies | Investments | Secure large-scale renewable energy sources (e.g., purchase of RECs)
| Gyeonggi-do | Administrative and institutional support | Reduce GHG emissions in Gyeonggi-do and industrial complexes by identifying win-win models for public-private partnerships and supporting companies to implement RE100|

(Procedure) Site selection → Announcement of private investment project → Evaluation of proposals received → Selection of business operator → Power plant construction and operation (RE100 implementation support)

RE100 Fund Establishment and Operation
(Purpose)Realization of carbon neutrality, support for corporate RE100, and financial foundation for just transition (support for vulnerable groups, etc.)

(Participants)Gyeonggi-do, 31 cities and counties

(Fund size)Establishment of a fund of approximately KRW 120 billion by 2026 (fully funded by the province)

| Breakdown | Total | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Total | 120 billion KRW | 40 billion KRW | 40 billion KRW | 40 billion KRW |

(Utilization) Investment support for renewable energy generation projects, support for greenhouse gas reduction projects, support for affected industries and workers, etc.

Energy efficiency support for SMEs
1) Guarantee/financing support for high-efficiency energy equipment installation projects

2) Financial support for energy efficiency SMEs

3) One-stop support for energy utilization efficiency
